The film was nominated for eight CÃ©sar Awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Actor for Reno.
 
However, the film was not well received in the United States, where it was re-edited and re-scored by Bill Conti to make it more appealing to American audiences. The original version of the film, with a music score by Ãric Serra, is 168 minutes long and is considered by many fans and critics to be superior to the shorter US version.

The film is based on the lives and achievements of two real-life free divers, Jacques Mayol and Enzo Maiorca, who set several world records in the no-limits category of deep diving. However, the film is not a biopic, but a fictionalized and dramatized account of their friendship and rivalry.
 
The film explores the themes of human connection, self-discovery and transcendence, as well as the beauty and mystery of the ocean. The film also features remarkable scenes of underwater photography and dolphin interaction, which were filmed with real dolphins in the Bahamas and the Mediterranean Sea.
 
Le Grand Bleu is a film that has inspired generations of viewers with its poetic and visionary depiction of the relationship between man and nature. It is a film that celebrates the spirit of adventure and the passion for life.

One of the most memorable aspects of the film is the music score by Ãric Serra, who composed a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly matches the mood and tone of the film. The main theme, "The Big Blue Overture", is a melancholic and ethereal piece that evokes the depth and vastness of the sea. The soundtrack also includes songs by various artists, such as Bill Withers, Andy Narell and Ãdith Piaf.
 
The film also features some memorable quotes that reflect the characters' personalities and philosophies. For example, Enzo says to Jacques: "You're not a fish. You're a man. You have to breathe." Jacques replies: "I breathe better down there." Another example is when Johana asks Jacques what it feels like when he dives. He says: "It's a feeling of slipping without falling. The hardest thing is when you're at the bottom." She asks: "Why?" He says: "Because you have to find a good reason to come back up... and I have a hard time finding one."
 
Le Grand Bleu is a film that has left a lasting impression on many people who have seen it. It is a film that invites the viewer to immerse themselves in a different world and to experience the emotions and sensations of the characters. It is a film that challenges the viewer to question their own limits and to explore their own potential.
